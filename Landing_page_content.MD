Welcome to the Clubhouse! Where children ages 5-12 join us for outdoor, hands-on learning sessions. Set on a working farm with forest, fields and friendly animals! (basically this paragraph was totally fine!) 

ON THE FARM! 

There really is no better setting for a classroom — from our farm-to-fork cooking classes to our STEM lessons exploring new farming technology and innovations. At The Clubhouse, children learn the science of growing, animal care, woodworking, and other traditional skills, all through hands-on experience. As our activities change with the seasons and the rhythms of the farm, our schedule is always evolving. Over the past year, the kids have enjoyed an incredible range of enriching activities.

During Spring, we were busy caring for baby chicks and lambs — including the unforgettable experience of bottle-feeding them! We got our allotments up and running, built fantastic enrichment toys in our woodworking sessions, planted pumpkins, and made the most of a wonderfully warm and sunny week spent outdoors.

In Autumn, we jumped straight back into pumpkin season fun. The children enjoyed carving and painting pumpkins, apple picking, tractor rides, and baking delicious cookies and pies. There was also plenty of time spent caring for the animals, building enrichment structures and chicken coops, collecting eggs, and enjoying cosy cooking sessions, alongside woodland picnics, outdoor games, and lots of fresh air.

Now, as the days grow lighter, we’re getting ready to welcome Spring back once again. Soon, the kids will be back in the soil — learning how to germinate seeds, raise and care for seedlings, mulch and weed beds, support climbing plants, and understand what helps crops thrive. They’ll head out on rounds with the farmers, test soil pH, learn what grows best in different areas of the farm, visit the beehives, and see how farming works on both small and large scales. And of course, the all-time favourite — helping to care for and cuddle the new baby animals!

With Spring just around the corner, we can’t wait to dig in, welcome the newest arrivals, and watch the farm come back to life once again. 🌱



Explore the Forest!

At The Clubhouse, the forest is our classroom! Kids will learn through hands-on adventures in the mile long woodlands adjacent to the farm. With our in house forest ranger the kids walk the beautiful paths cut through the woods and learn all sorts of useful information about the forest, animals and mini-beasts that live there  From den building and bug hunts to learning about local wildlife, our forest sessions will give them a greater understanding of Scottish woodlands.



Caring for the Farm Animals

At The Clubhouse, kids don’t just visit the farm—they become part of it! From helping to get the new lambs bottle-feeding to helping raise chicks this past spring, children get hands-on experience caring for animals while learning how a farm works and basics of animal care.

They’ve helped to chop and prep treats, feed the goats, brush the ponies, build animal enrichment activities for the farm. 

With all sorts of treasures found around the farm- like suet from the butcher for bird feeders or old fruit baskets turned into animal toys- the farm becomes a brilliant little world for learning how to reuse and get creative. 

Whether it’s cuddling a fluffy chick or watching lambs take their first steps, every moment is a fun and unforgettable lesson in animal care.
